#Descrition
in this assignment i worked with the in-class build files (the Puzzle Drag and Drop), and the code i started with had two bugs. 
The first bug was You could drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone and it should be only one piece at a time instead.
The second bug was the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a
new puzzle. 
the idea was to prevent that from happening and look up a solution to drag and drop only one piece into a drop zone at a time, and 
provide the user a fresh board to drop onto(by clicking on the same piece again or refreching the page).
